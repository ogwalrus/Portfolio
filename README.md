# Portfolio
This website serves as a portfolio for potential employees to showcase their previous work. 

## How to Use
The website is straightforward and easy to use. Upon loading, the user is presented with the developer's name, photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. Clicking on any of the links in the navigation will take the user to the corresponding section, and clicking on the link to the section about the developer's work will take the user to a section with titled images of their applications.
