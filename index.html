        <p>Hello, my name is Tom and I am a full stack web developer that is still learning. I am passionate about creating innovative, user-friendly, and efficient web applications that can solve complex problems and improve user experience.

          My technical skills include proficiency in multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, as well as in various front-end and back-end technologies such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am experienced in working with databases, servers, APIs, and various web development tools.

          Apart from my technical skills, I am a highly collaborative and creative professional who enjoys working in teams and finding solutions to complex problems. I have a keen eye for design, and I understand the importance of creating visually appealing interfaces that provide a great user experience.

          Throughout my time learning, I have worked on a variety of projects that range from e-commerce platforms to content management systems and social networking sites. I have a deep understanding of how web applications work and how to optimize them for speed, scalability, and performance.
